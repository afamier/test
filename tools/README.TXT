keywords were used in scripts:
1. simsrv      --- special for /dinstar/bin/simsrv
2. simsafe     --- special for /dinstar/bin/simsafe
3. start_app   --- special for /dinstar/bin/start_app.sh
4. stop_app    --- special for /dinstar/bin/stop_app.sh

be careful while killing processes by keywords in scripts! e.g.
1. sudo killall simsrv
2. sudo killall simsafe
